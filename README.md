**Down** is a simple browser scratchpad â€” for when you'd rather not fire up a text editor for whatever reason.

## Features

Anything entered in the editor is automatically saved in localStorage.

Add a hash to the URL to customise the page; provide two hexadecimal colour codes separated by a dash for the background and foreground:

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> to save your notes as a `.txt` file.
